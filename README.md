# Graph-based-Segment-Tree-Construction

This project is regarding a stereo matching algorithm
Conceptually, Segement tree can be constructed with the reference image in a three-step process:
  1. Image pixels are grouped into a set of segments
  2. A subtree is built for each segment
  3. All the subtrees are linked to produce the Ô¨Ånal tree.

Step 1 is a typical image segmentation problem, while step-2 and step-3 enforce the connectivity inside and around each segment respectively.
